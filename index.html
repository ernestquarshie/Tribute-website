    <h2>Brief Biography</h2>
    <h4>Early life:</h4>
    <p>
      Leonardo da Vinci was born on April 15, 1452, in the small village of Anchiano, near Vinci, in what is now Italy. He was the illegitimate son of Ser Piero, a notary, and a peasant woman named Caterina. Despite his illegitimacy, Leonardo was raised in his father's household and received an informal education in Latin, geometry, and mathematics.
    </p>
    <h4>Artistic apprenticeship:</h4>
    <p>At the age of 15, Leonardo was apprenticed to Andrea del Verrocchio, a renowned artist in Florence. Under Verrocchio's tutelage, Leonardo honed his skills in painting, sculpture, and mechanical arts. His talents quickly surpassed those of his master, and he was soon recognized for his exceptional artistic abilities.
    </p>
    <h4>Professional Career:</h4>
    <p>
Leonardo's career took him to various Italian cities, including Florence, Milan, and Rome. He worked for powerful patrons such as Ludovico Sforza, the Duke of Milan, and Lorenzo de' Medici. During this time, he created some of his most famous works, including "The Last Supper" and "Mona Lisa". His art was characterized by his innovative use of perspective, light, and anatomy, which brought his subjects to life with unparalleled realism.
    </p>
    <h4>Scientific and Engineering Pursuits:</h4>
    <p>
      Leonardo's interests extended far beyond art. He meticulously documented his observations of the natural world in his notebooks, which contained studies on anatomy, botany, physics, and engineering. He designed various machines, including early concepts for flying machines, tanks, and bridges, showcasing his visionary ideas and understanding of mechanics.
    </p>
    <h4>Later Years and Legacy:</h4>
    <p>
      In his later years, Leonardo worked in Rome, Bologna, and Venice before moving to France at the invitation of King Francis I. He spent his final years at the Château du Clos Lucé near Amboise, where he continued to work and teach until his death on May 2, 1519.

Leonardo da Vinci is remembered as one of the most diversely talented individuals in history. His contributions to art, science, and engineering have left an indelible mark on the world, making him a quintessential figure of the Renaissance and a timeless symbol of human curiosity and ingenuity.
